# Customer-Credit-Analytics
Credit One, a third-party credit rating authority that provides retail customer credit approval services to businesses.  Credit One has tasked us with examining current customer demographics to better understand what traits might relate to whether or not a customer is likely to default on their current credit obligations. Understanding this is vital to the success of Credit One because their business model depends on customers paying their debts.  The task here is as a Data Scientist will be to identify which customer attributes relate significantly to customer default rates and to build a predictive model that Customer One can use to better classify potential customers as being ‘at-risk’, compared to previously implemented models. You will use ensemble machine learning classification methods in Python for this task.
